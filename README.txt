Maria-Luiza Taskova, Scheduling P1.R

For this assignment I built 5 out of the 6 required schedulers, in particular: FIFO, SJF, STCF, Round Robin, and Duration lottery schedulers. After each scheduler the program outputs the average turnaround time.
The program takes a commandline argument of an input file name (and path in case the file is not in the project folder)
I used the input.txt file that is also currently loaded by default
My apologies but I couldn't implement the PMLQ scheduler (I can try to submit that later on but we can talk and decide)
